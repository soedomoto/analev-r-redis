R + Python + Redis + Webdis

AnalevR is a comprehensive R-based analysis platform service that allows anyone from anywhere to access data for free, perform analyses, and create visualization without having to own the original micro data. <br />

Please note that AnalevR is not an online analysis tool. But rather an environment that provides access to BPS-Statistics Indonesia data and ...... <br />

We can use online market as an analogy. In online market such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> or <a href="http://www.alibaba.com/">Alibaba</a>, they online provide the market place, but the things that are sold are supplied by the sellers. <br />
The same concept is applied in AnalevR. AnalevR provides the _environment_ or _platform_ for accessing data for free and conducting analysis. But the analysis modules are contributed by the users. As an initial step, We already preloaded AnalevR with several basic analysis modules such as Linear Regression. Afterward, users are given opportunities to construct their own analysis modules using the menu provided. The user can choose whether they want to work in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) mode or non-GUI mode (syntax editor).
